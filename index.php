        <h2>Preface</h2>

        <p>This book represents the first volume in a series of three. This series, and this book in particular, is for you if you&rsquo;ve never programmed before and you would like to learn JavaScript. By the conclusion of this first book, you will have learned 100% of the JavaScript you need to know in order to write a chess game, complete with an AI. And, by the conclusion of the third book, we will have programmed the game and AI, together.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is a gnarly language. There are many nooks and crannies
        that book authors can either explore or ignore. Consequently,
         JavaScript books tend to either skip over the nitty-gritty details of the language, or they tediously expound upon the minutiae.</p>

        <p>This book presents the big picture, along with the option to ignore, skim, or scrutinize many of the finer details of JavaScript. The way I&rsquo;ve managed to pull this off, is that I&rsquo;ve made extensive use of sidenotes.</p>

        <p>
            If you&rsquo;re inclined, feel free to enrich your understanding of JavaScript by diving deep into the sidenotes. Or, feel free to stay shallow, which is all you need for us to build a chess AI together.

        <h2>Contents</h2>

        <p>This left-most column contains three parts:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Front matter, including the title, preface, and this table of contents</li>
            <li><a href='#snippets'>Snippets</a>, which contains a &ldquo;snippet&rdquo; of code from each step in the book, along with a link from each snippet to its associated step</li>
            <li><a href='#'>Steps enumerated</a>, which contains each step, one after the other, including a table of contents.  This part is for you, if you would like to read, skim, or scrutinize the book in an old fashioned, page-by-page fashion.
        </ol>

        <p>Lastly, as you can see, there is a &ldquo;repl&rdquo; on the side of your window. We begin our study of JavaScript, by describing and demonstrating the repl in Step 1.</p>
